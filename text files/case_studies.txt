==================================================

CLIENT PROFILE
Company: Online retail company (apparel and accessories)
Size: 8 employees, $2M annual revenue
Location: Portland, OR
Industry: E-commerce / Retail

THE CHALLENGE

The company was experiencing rapid growth but drowning in manual order processing:

- Processing 200-300 orders per week manually
- Each order required 5-6 steps across multiple systems:
  * Copy order from Shopify
  * Create invoice in QuickBooks
  * Update inventory spreadsheet
  * Generate packing slip
  * Send confirmation email
  * Log order in tracking spreadsheet

Time investment:
- 15 hours per week on order processing (one person full-time)
- Additional 5 hours/week fixing errors from manual data entry
- Total: 20 hours/week = 80 hours/month

Costs:
- Labor: 80 hours × $25/hour = $2,000/month
- Error costs: Missed shipments, duplicate orders, inventory discrepancies = ~$500/month
- Total pain: $2,500/month

Additional impact:
- Person doing order processing was the co-founder's spouse (should be working ON the business, not IN it)
- Growth was limited by order processing capacity
- Customer experience suffered (delays, errors in confirmation emails)
- Inventory tracking was unreliable
