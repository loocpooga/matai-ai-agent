Matai Tech - Detailed Implementation Process

==================================================
PROCESS OVERVIEW
==================================================

Our implementation process is designed to deliver value incrementally while ensuring reliability and proper handoff. You'll see working automations within the first week, not at the end of a multi-month project.

Timeline Summary:
- Efficiency Package: 1-2 weeks total
- Growth Package: 2-4 weeks total
- Transformation Package: 4-8 weeks total (but first automation live in week 1)

Communication Cadence:
- Daily: Async updates via Slack/Email
- Weekly: 30-minute check-in calls
- As-needed: Video calls for complex discussions

==================================================
WHAT HAPPENS IF THINGS GO WRONG?
==================================================

We're realistic - not everything goes perfectly. Here's our approach:

IF AUTOMATION FAILS:
1. Automatic alert sent to us (often before you notice)
2. We investigate and fix issue
3. We notify you of what happened and resolution
4. We update error handling to prevent recurrence

IF WE MISS A REQUIREMENT:
1. We add it at no additional cost (within reason)
2. Test thoroughly
3. Deploy quickly
4. Document the change

IF TIMELINE SLIPS:
1. We communicate proactively
2. Explain reason (usually scope clarification or edge cases)
3. Propose adjusted timeline
4. Deliver quick win while working on larger item

IF YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED:
1. We listen and understand concerns
2. Make adjustments until you're happy
3. If still not satisfied: 30-day ROI guarantee applies
4. Refund setup fee if automation doesn't deliver value

==================================================
