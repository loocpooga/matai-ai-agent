Matai Tech - Company Overview

==================================================
WHO WE ARE
==================================================

Matai Tech is a business automation consultancy that helps operations-heavy companies eliminate repetitive work and scale efficiently through intelligent automation.

We specialize in helping small and growing businesses (typically 10-50 employees) who are:
- Drowning in manual processes
- Outgrowing spreadsheets and disconnected tools
- Ready to scale but held back by operational bottlenecks
- Behind on technology adoption but ready to catch up

==================================================
OUR MISSION
==================================================

We believe every hour spent on repetitive manual work is an hour stolen from what actually grows your business - serving customers, building products, and strategic thinking.

Our mission is to help operations-heavy companies recover that time by building reliable, custom automation that actually works.

==================================================
WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT
==================================================

1. VALUE-FIRST APPROACH
We don't sell you automations - we sell you time back. Our pricing is based on the ROI you get, not the hours we spend. If an automation doesn't deliver measurable value, we haven't done our job.

2. NO UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY
We use no-code and low-code tools (n8n, Make, Zapier) that are reliable, maintainable, and cost-effective. No expensive custom software. No vendor lock-in. Just practical solutions that work.

3. OPERATIONS-HEAVY EXPERTISE
We understand operations because we've lived it. We know what it's like to have a small team drowning in manual work. We speak your language, not just tech jargon.

4. INCREMENTAL VALUE DELIVERY
You see working automations in week 1, not at the end of a 3-month project. We deliver value incrementally so you can validate ROI early and often.

5. REALISTIC ABOUT AUTOMATION
We won't automate everything or promise magic. Some processes should stay manual. We help you identify the 20% of work that delivers 80% of the value when automated.

==================================================
OUR BACKGROUND
==================================================

Matai Tech was founded to serve the overlooked middle market - companies that are too small for enterprise consultants but too complex for DIY automation tools.

We've seen firsthand how operations-heavy businesses struggle:
- Spending 15+ hours/week on manual data entry and reporting
- Using 10+ disconnected tools with no integration
- Losing revenue opportunities because leads fall through the cracks
- Unable to scale because current processes don't scale

We built Matai Tech to fix this - practical automation that delivers real ROI without enterprise complexity or price tags.

==================================================
OUR CORE VALUES
==================================================

OUTCOMES OVER ACTIVITY
We measure success by the time you save and revenue you unlock, not the number of automations we build.

TRANSPARENCY
You'll always know what we're working on, why it matters, and what ROI to expect. No black boxes.

RELIABILITY
Automations that work 99% of the time are worthless - they create more work than they save. We build for 99.9%+ reliability with proper error handling and monitoring.

PARTNERSHIP
We're not a vendor you hire and forget. We're a partner invested in your operational success. Your wins are our wins.

PRAGMATISM
We recommend the simplest solution that works, even if it's not the most technically impressive. Boring technology that works beats cutting-edge technology that breaks.

==================================================
WHO WE SERVE BEST
==================================================

IDEAL INDUSTRIES
- E-commerce and retail
- Professional services (agencies, consulting, legal, accounting)
- SaaS and software companies
- Manufacturing and distribution
- Healthcare and medical practices
- Real estate and property management

IDEAL COMPANY STAGE
- Revenue: $500K - $10M annually
- Employees: 5-50 people
- Growth stage: Scaling but still hands-on
- Tech maturity: Using SaaS tools but minimal custom automation

IDEAL SITUATION
- Spending 10+ hours/week on repetitive tasks
- Using multiple disconnected tools (CRM, accounting, project management, etc.)
- Losing revenue due to manual process delays
- Ready to invest in operational efficiency

==================================================
WHAT WE DON'T DO
==================================================

To set clear expectations, we are NOT:
- A custom software development agency (we automate, we don't build apps)
- An IT department or help desk
- A business process consulting firm (we automate existing processes, not redesign them)
- Offshore outsourcing (we're a U.S.-based boutique consultancy)

==================================================
OUR APPROACH TO AUTOMATION
==================================================

1. IDENTIFY HIGH-ROI OPPORTUNITIES
Not everything should be automated. We help you identify the 3-5 processes that will deliver the biggest impact.

2. START WITH QUICK WINS
We build your highest-ROI automation first so you see value within 1-2 weeks, not months.

3. BUILD INCREMENTALLY
We deliver working automations one at a time, not everything at once. You can validate value before we move to the next automation.

4. ENSURE RELIABILITY
Every automation includes proper error handling, monitoring, and alerts. If something breaks, we know immediately.

5. TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE
We document everything and train your team. You're never dependent on us to understand how your systems work.

==================================================
TYPICAL RESULTS
==================================================

Our clients typically see:
- 10-20 hours/week saved in manual work
- 2-4 month payback period on investment
- 3-10x ROI in first year
- 95%+ accuracy on automated processes
- 99%+ uptime on critical automations

These results come from focusing on high-impact automations and building for reliability from day one.

==================================================
OUR GUARANTEE
==================================================

We stand behind our work with a 30-Day ROI Guarantee:

If your automation doesn't deliver the promised time/cost savings within 30 days, we'll refund your setup fee and continue working at no charge until it does.

We only succeed when you succeed.
