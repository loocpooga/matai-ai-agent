Matai Tech - Detailed Services Guide

==================================================
SERVICE PHILOSOPHY
==================================================

We don't just build automations - we solve operational problems that cost you time and money.

Every service we offer is designed to:
- Deliver measurable ROI (time savings, cost reduction, or revenue growth)
- Use reliable, maintainable technology (no-code/low-code tools)
- Include proper error handling and monitoring
- Be documented and transferable to your team

==================================================
CORE SERVICE 1: BUSINESS PROCESS AUTOMATION
==================================================

WHAT IT IS
Automating repetitive, rule-based tasks that currently require manual work. We turn multi-step manual processes into automated workflows that run reliably 24/7.

COMMON EXAMPLES
- Lead capture from website forms → auto-create CRM records → send welcome emails → notify sales team
- Order received → update inventory → create invoice → send confirmation → log in accounting system
- New client signed → create project in PM tool → generate folders in Drive → send onboarding email → schedule kickoff
- Support ticket created → categorize by keywords → route to right team → send acknowledgment → escalate if urgent
- Employee submits expense → extract receipt data → verify against policy → route for approval → sync to accounting
- Content published → post to social media → update website → notify subscribers → track engagement

WHAT'S INCLUDED
- Process mapping and workflow design
- Automation implementation using n8n, Make, or Zapier
- Error handling (what happens when something fails)
- Testing with real data
- Monitoring and alerts
- Documentation for your team

TECHNOLOGIES USED
- n8n (open-source, self-hosted option for complex workflows)
