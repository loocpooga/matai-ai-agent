Matai Tech - Frequently Asked Questions

==================================================
PRICING AND ROI
==================================================

Q: How much does automation cost?
A: Our packages range from $3,500 setup + $350/month (Efficiency) to custom pricing for Transformation packages (typically $15K-30K setup + $1,500-3,000/month). We also offer a Discovery Sprint for $1,500 if you want to test the waters first.

The real question isn't "how much does it cost?" but "what's the ROI?" Our typical clients see 3-10x ROI in the first year, with payback periods of 1-4 months.

Example: If you're spending 20 hours/month on manual work at $50/hour, that's $1,000/month in labor cost. Our Efficiency Package at $350/month saves you $1,000, netting you $650/month = $7,800/year savings from a $3,850 first-year investment (2x ROI).

Q: That seems expensive. How do I justify the cost?
A: Think investment, not expense. Consider what you're currently spending:

Hidden labor costs:
- 20 hours/week manual work × $30/hour = $31,200/year
- Our automation saves 80% = $24,960/year savings
- Investment: $3,500 + ($350 × 12) = $7,700 first year
- Net savings: $17,260 first year
- ROI: 3.2x

Opportunity cost:
- What could your team do with 20 extra hours per week?
- More customer calls? More sales outreach? Product development?
- That's the real value automation unlocks

Compare to alternatives:
- Hiring additional staff: $40K-60K/year + benefits
- Enterprise automation platforms: $5K-20K/month
- Offshore outsourcing: $2K-5K/month (unreliable, time zone issues)

Q: What if the automation doesn't work or breaks?
A: 30-Day ROI Guarantee: If the automation doesn't save you the promised time within 30 days, we'll refund your setup fee and continue working at no charge until it does.

Additionally:
- We build with 99%+ reliability from day one
- Proactive monitoring alerts us to issues before you notice
- Monthly fee includes fixes and maintenance
- We often fix problems before they impact you

In 2+ years, our clients experience 99.2% average uptime across all automations.

Q: Can we start with something smaller to test the waters?
A: Absolutely! Our Discovery Sprint ($1,500) is perfect for this:
- 1-week engagement
- We identify your highest-ROI automation opportunity
- Build a working proof-of-concept
- You see results before committing to full package
- If you proceed, the $1,500 applies to your package setup fee

This lets you:
- Test our process and communication style
- Validate ROI before larger investment
- Build confidence in automation

Q: Do you offer payment plans?
A: Yes, for larger packages:
- Setup fee can be split into 2-3 monthly payments
- Monthly maintenance fee billed monthly (not annually)
- No long-term contracts (month-to-month after setup)

For Transformation packages, we can structure payment around milestones.

Q: What's included in the monthly fee?
A: The monthly fee covers:
- Proactive monitoring (24/7 automated, business hours for issues)
- Fix any errors or issues that arise
- Monthly optimization and improvements
- Support for questions or change requests
- Performance reporting
- Hours allocated (2-10 hours depending on package)
- Quarterly strategy reviews (Growth & Transformation)

Think of it as insurance + maintenance + ongoing improvement.

Q: Can we pause or cancel anytime?
A: Yes - month-to-month after initial implementation:
- 30 days notice to pause or cancel
- We provide full documentation and handoff materials
- You keep all automations we built
- Can restart service anytime

We're confident in our value delivery - we don't need contracts to keep clients.

Q: What happens if we cancel?
A: You keep everything:
- All automations continue running
- Full documentation and access
- No kill switch or vendor lock-in
- Can manage it yourself or hire someone else

We build on platforms you control (your n8n instance, your Make/Zapier account). You're never dependent on us.

==================================================
IMPLEMENTATION AND TIMELINE
==================================================

Q: How long does implementation take?
A: Depends on package:
- Efficiency Package: 1-2 weeks
- Growth Package: 2-4 weeks
- Transformation Package: 4-8 weeks

BUT - you see working automations within the first week, not at the end. We deliver incrementally.

Week 1: First automation live and delivering value
Week 2-4: Additional automations deployed one at a time
Ongoing: Optimization and refinement

Q: Do we need technical knowledge to use the automations?
A: No. We design everything to be user-friendly:
- Most automations run automatically in the background
- When you need to interact, it's simple (click a button, send an email)
- Full training provided (video + live session + documentation)
- Monitoring dashboards show status at a glance

If you can use email and spreadsheets, you can use our automations.

Q: What do you need from us during implementation?
A: Four main things:

1. Access (one-time):
   - Credentials for systems to integrate
   - Admin permissions where needed
   - Usually takes 30 minutes to set up

2. Knowledge (discovery phase):
   - Explain your processes and business rules
   - Answer questions about edge cases
   - Provide sample/test data
   - 2-3 hours total spread over a week

3. Testing (build phase):
   - Review automations in staging (15-30 min each)
   - Validate results match expectations
   - Provide feedback
   - 1-2 hours per automation

4. Availability (ongoing):
   - Weekly 30-min check-in calls
   - Respond to questions within 24-48 hours
   - Participate in training (90 minutes)

Total time commitment: 5-10 hours spread over implementation period.

Q: Can you work around our schedule?
A: Absolutely:
- Async communication via Slack/email (we adapt to your timezone)
- Flexible meeting times (early morning, evening, weekends if needed)
- Recorded training sessions (watch on your schedule)
- We do the heavy lifting - you provide guidance when needed

Most clients find our async approach less disruptive than traditional consulting.

Q: What if we discover new requirements during implementation?
A: Common and expected:
- Minor adjustments: Included at no additional cost
- Significant scope changes: We'll discuss impact on timeline/cost
- Edge cases discovered: We handle them as part of implementation

We plan for iteration and refinement. Getting it right is more important than sticking to original spec.

Q: Do you work with remote/distributed teams?
A: That's our default - we're remote-first:
- All communication via Slack, email, video calls
- Documentation accessible from anywhere
- Automations work regardless of where your team is
- Training sessions recorded for different time zones

We've worked with teams across US, Canada, Europe, and Australia.

==================================================
TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS
==================================================

Q: Do you work with our existing tools or require new software?
A: We work with your existing tools whenever possible:
- CRMs: Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, etc.
- Accounting: QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, etc.
- E-commerce: Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, etc.
- Project Management: Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Notion, etc.
- Email: Gmail, Outlook, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, etc.

Sometimes we might recommend a free or low-cost tool if it makes automation much easier, but we never require expensive new software.

Q: What automation platforms do you use?
A: We specialize in three:

1. n8n (most complex workflows):
   - Open-source, self-hosted option
   - Most powerful and customizable
   - Lower long-term costs
   - Best for: Complex workflows, data privacy requirements

2. Make.com (mid-complexity):
   - Visual workflow builder
   - Extensive integration library
   - Good balance of power and ease
   - Best for: Multi-step workflows across many tools

3. Zapier (simplest):
   - Easiest to understand
   - Great for teams already using it
   - Large integration ecosystem
   - Best for: Simple workflows, non-technical teams

We choose based on your needs, technical comfort, and budget.

Q: What if our system doesn't have an API?
A: Options:

1. Use web scraping/automation (Puppeteer, Selenium)
   - More fragile, requires more maintenance
   - Last resort option

2. Export/import via files (CSV, Excel)
   - Not real-time but often good enough
   - Scheduled batch processing

3. Database direct access (if available)
   - Most reliable for legacy systems
   - Requires database permissions

4. Recommend migration to modern tool
   - Sometimes the best long-term solution

We're honest about limitations - if integration is too fragile or expensive, we'll tell you.

Q: Who owns the automations you build?
A: You do:
- Built on your accounts (your Make/Zapier subscription)
- Full admin access from day one
- Complete documentation provided
- No proprietary code or lock-in
- Can export and manage yourself anytime

We're building on platforms you control, not ours.

Q: What if the automation platform shuts down or changes?
A: Risk mitigation built in:
- We use established platforms (Zapier since 2011, Make since 2012)
- n8n is open-source (can self-host forever)
- Workflows are portable (can rebuild on different platform)
- We document logic clearly (not dependent on specific platform)

Additionally, modern SaaS platforms are more stable than custom code that requires ongoing maintenance.

Q: Can you integrate with [specific tool]?
A: Most likely yes. Common integration categories:
- CRMs and sales tools
- Accounting and finance software
- E-commerce platforms
- Project management tools
- Email and marketing automation
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Spreadsheets (Google Sheets, Excel, Airtable)
- Communication tools (Slack, Teams, Discord)
- File storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)

If a tool has an API or webhook support, we can integrate it.
If it doesn't, we'll explore workarounds or recommend alternatives.

==================================================
RELIABILITY AND SUPPORT
==================================================

Q: What happens if an automation fails?
A: Multi-layer safety net:

1. Automatic retry (most transient errors resolve themselves)
2. Error notifications sent to us immediately
3. We investigate and fix (usually within hours)
4. You're notified of issue and resolution
5. Error handling prevents data loss or corruption

Our 99%+ uptime track record means failures are rare and quickly resolved.

Q: How do you monitor automations?
A: Three levels:

1. Platform monitoring:
   - Zapier/Make/n8n built-in error tracking
   - Automatic alerts on failures

2. Custom monitoring:
   - Expected volume checks (if usually 50/day and suddenly 0, something's wrong)
   - Data validation checks
   - Performance monitoring

3. Regular audits:
   - Monthly review of all automations
   - Proactive optimization
   - Preventive maintenance

You also get a dashboard showing runs, success rates, and any issues.

Q: What are your support hours and response times?
A: Support included in monthly fee:

Business Hours: Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm EST

Response times:
- Critical issues (automation down): 4 hours
- Important (not working as expected): 24 hours
- General questions: 48 hours
- Enhancement requests: Discussed in monthly planning

Critical issues are rare due to proactive monitoring, but when they occur, we prioritize them.

Q: Do you offer after-hours or weekend support?
A: Emergency support available as add-on ($200/month):
- Same-day response to urgent issues
- After-hours availability
- Priority phone/video support
- Dedicated Slack/Teams channel

Standard packages include business-hours support, which works for 95% of clients since automations run reliably.

Q: What if you go out of business?
A: You're protected:
- You own everything (built on your accounts)
- Full documentation provided
- No proprietary systems
- Can manage yourself or hire someone else
- Code is exportable

But to be direct: We're profitable, growing sustainably, and focused on long-term client relationships, not venture funding or unsustainable growth.

==================================================
PROCESS AND APPROACH
==================================================

Q: What if we don't know which processes to automate?
A: That's exactly what our Discovery phase is for:
- We analyze your operations
- Interview your team
- Map current workflows
- Identify highest-ROI opportunities
- Prioritize by impact and complexity

Most companies have 3-5 obvious wins. We'll find them.

Q: Do you redesign our business processes?
A: No - we automate existing processes:
- We'll suggest minor adjustments to make automation easier
- We'll point out obvious inefficiencies
- But we're not business process consultants

If your processes need major redesign, we can recommend consultants. Once processes are solid, we'll automate them.

Q: Can you automate [very complex process]?
A: Maybe - but we're honest about limitations:

Good candidates for automation:
- Rule-based decisions (if X then Y)
- Repetitive, consistent tasks
- High volume
- Clear success criteria

Poor candidates:
- Requires subjective judgment
- Constantly changing rules
- Exception-heavy processes
- Requires human creativity or empathy

We'll tell you if automation isn't the right solution.

Q: How do you handle our data and security?
A: Security-first approach:

Access:
- Minimum required permissions only
- Service accounts (not personal credentials)
- Credentials stored in encrypted password managers
- Access revocable anytime

Data handling:
- Data processed, not stored (except necessary caching)
- No data sharing with third parties
- GDPR and privacy-conscious by default
- Can sign NDA and data processing agreements

Compliance:
- Built on SOC 2 compliant platforms (Zapier, Make)
- Can work with your compliance requirements
- Documentation for your security audits

Q: What if our needs change or we want to add more automations?
A: Easy - that's what monthly hours are for:
- Efficiency Package: 2 hours/month for changes
- Growth Package: 5 hours/month for changes
- Transformation Package: 10+ hours/month

Changes could be:
- New automation requests
- Modify existing automations
- Optimization and improvements
- Integrating new tools

If needs significantly increase, we can adjust package tier.

Q: Do you train our team?
A: Yes - included in all packages:
- Live training session (60-90 minutes)
- Video walkthrough of each automation
- Written documentation with screenshots
- Q&A sessions as needed

Training covers:
- What each automation does
- How to monitor status
- What to do if issues occur
- How to request changes

Your team won't need ongoing training - automations are designed to be self-explanatory.

==================================================
COMPARISON AND ALTERNATIVES
==================================================

Q: Why not just hire someone full-time?
A: Cost comparison:

Junior automation engineer:
- Salary: $60K-80K/year
- Benefits: +30% = $78K-104K/year
- Recruitment time: 2-3 months
- Ramp-up time: 3-6 months
- Single person (vacation, sick days, turnover risk)

Matai Tech:
- Cost: $7,700-28,200/year (depending on package)
- Available immediately
- Start seeing results week 1
- Team expertise (not single person)
- No turnover risk

Full-time hire makes sense at certain scale (usually $20M+ revenue or if you need 40+ hours/month of automation work).

Q: Why not use Zapier/Make ourselves?
A: You can! And for simple workflows, you should.

Where we add value:
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Error handling and edge cases
- Integration between many systems
- Reliable architecture from day one
- Ongoing monitoring and optimization

DIY works great for simple tasks. But:
- What happens when it breaks at 2am?
- Do you have time to maintain it?
- Can you handle edge cases properly?
- Will it scale as volume increases?

We're like hiring a professional contractor vs. DIY home renovation - depends on complexity and your available time.

Q: Why not hire a freelancer on Upwork?
A: Freelancers can work for simple one-off projects.

Differences:
- Quality varies wildly (no guarantee of reliability)
- Often disappear after project (no ongoing support)
- May not include proper error handling
- Limited accountability
- Time zone and communication challenges

We're a consultancy, not gig workers:
- Accountable for reliability and ROI
- Ongoing support and optimization
- Business-hours availability
- Long-term partnership approach

Q: What about offshore outsourcing?
A: Offshore works for some companies. Challenges:
- Communication barriers
- Time zone mismatches
- Quality control
- Data security concerns
- Limited business understanding
- High turnover

We're US-based (clear communication, timezone overlap, understand US business practices) while being cost-effective through our productized approach.

Q: How are you different from other automation consultants?
A: Key differences:

1. Value-based pricing (ROI-focused, not hourly)
2. Productized packages (clear scope and pricing)
3. 30-day ROI guarantee (we stand behind results)
4. Incremental delivery (value in week 1)
5. Operations-heavy focus (we speak your language)
6. Reliability-first (99%+ uptime commitment)

Most automation consultants charge $150-300/hour with unclear total costs and no ROI guarantee.
