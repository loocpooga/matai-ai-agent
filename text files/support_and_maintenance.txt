APIs and platforms change regularly. We stay on top of it:

2. Assess impact on your automations
3. Test changes in staging
4. Update production automations
5. Document changes
6. Notify you if behavior changes

You never need to track platform updates yourself.

Example scenarios:

API deprecation:
- Platform announces API endpoint deprecation
- We receive notice (usually 3-6 months advance)
- We update automation to new endpoint
- Test thoroughly
- Deploy update before deadline
- You notice nothing (seamless transition)

New features:
- Platform releases new capability
- We evaluate if beneficial for you
- Implement if improves automation
- Document enhancement
- Report in monthly check-in

Breaking changes:
- Platform makes breaking change (rare)
- We adapt automation to work with new version
- Test extensively
- Deploy with minimal downtime
- Communicate any required changes on your end

==================================================
