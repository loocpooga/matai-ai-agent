Matai Tech - Business Automation & AI Solutions
Value-Based Pricing Guide

==================================================
WHO WE SERVE
==================================================

Matai Tech partners with operations-heavy small businesses and growing companies (typically 10-50 employees) who are ready to eliminate manual work and scale their operations through intelligent automation.

We specialize in helping companies that:
- Spend significant time on repetitive manual tasks
- Are outgrowing spreadsheets and manual processes
- Want to scale but are held back by operational bottlenecks
- Need custom automation that off-the-shelf tools can't provide

==================================================
OUR PRICING PHILOSOPHY
==================================================

We don't charge for hours or features - we charge based on the value we deliver.

Why? Because what matters to you is the outcome:
- How much time will you save?
- How much cost will you eliminate?
- How much revenue can you unlock?

Our pricing is designed so you always get 3-10x ROI on your investment. If an automation isn't delivering measurable value, we haven't done our job.

ALTERNATIVE ENGAGEMENT OPTIONS

DISCOVERY SPRINT
--------------------------------------------------
Investment: $1,500

Not sure where to start? Our 1-week Discovery Sprint identifies your highest-ROI automation opportunity and builds a working proof-of-concept.

Perfect for companies who:
- Want to see results before committing to a full package
- Need help prioritizing which processes to automate first
- Want to validate ROI before larger investment

PROJECT-BASED ENGAGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------
Investment: 20-30% of first-year ROI

For companies who prefer project-based pricing:

Example: Your team spends 15 hours/week on manual reporting
- Annual labor cost: $25,000 (15 hrs/week × 52 weeks × $30/hr)
- Automation saves 80% = $20,000/year savings
- Project price: $4,000-6,000 (20-30% of year 1 savings)
- Optional maintenance retainer: $500/month

==================================================
ROI CALCULATOR
==================================================

Use this simple formula to estimate your potential ROI:

1. Hours spent per week on manual task: ____ hours
2. Average hourly cost (salary + benefits): $____ /hour
3. Monthly cost = (hours × 4 weeks × hourly cost): $____
4. Automation typically saves 70-90% of this time
5. Your potential monthly savings: $____

Compare that to our monthly fee and you'll see the ROI.

==================================================
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
==================================================

Q: That seems expensive. How do I justify the cost?
A: Think investment, not expense. If you're spending 20 hours/month on manual work at $50/hour, that's $1,000/month in labor cost. The Efficiency Package at $350/month pays for itself in month 1 and continues delivering value month after month. You're not paying for software - you're recovering thousands in hidden labor costs.

Q: What if the automation doesn't work or breaks?
A: 30-Day ROI Guarantee - If the automation doesn't save you the promised time within 30 days, we'll refund your setup fee and continue working at no charge until it does. Your monthly fee includes proactive monitoring and immediate fixes if anything breaks.

Q: Can we start with something smaller to test the waters?
A: Absolutely! Our Discovery Sprint ($1,500) is perfect for this. We identify your highest-ROI automation opportunity and build a proof-of-concept in one week. If you're happy with the results, the $1,500 applies to your full package setup fee.

Q: How long does implementation take?
A: Efficiency Package: 1-2 weeks
   Growth Package: 2-4 weeks
   Transformation Package: 4-8 weeks

   We provide value incrementally - you'll see working automations within the first week, not at the end of the project.

Q: Do we need technical knowledge to use the automations?
A: No. We design everything to be user-friendly and provide full training. Most automations run in the background automatically. When you need to interact with them, it's as simple as clicking a button or sending an email.

Q: What happens if we want to pause or cancel?
A: Our monthly services are month-to-month. You can pause or cancel anytime with 30 days' notice. We'll provide documentation and handoff materials. The automations we build are yours to keep.

Q: Do you work with our existing tools or require new software?
A: We work with your existing tools - Salesforce, HubSpot, QuickBooks, Shopify, spreadsheets, etc. In some cases, we might recommend a free or low-cost tool that makes automation easier, but we never require expensive new software.

Q: What if we don't know which processes to automate?
A: That's exactly what our Discovery phase is for. We'll analyze your operations, interview your team, and identify the highest-ROI opportunities. Most companies have 3-5 processes that are obvious wins - we'll find them.

==================================================
